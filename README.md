# Short_term_retal-pricing-project

Capstone Two – Project Proposal

Problem Identification and Context: Short-term rental market experienced impressive growth since AirBnB revolutionized the segment in 2008. Other online platforms emerged, and the home-sharing concept grew into a global industry with estimated revenue of USD 82.78 billion and 701.9 million users in 2022.

The short-term rental market consists mainly of individuals renting private accommodations. Therefore, pricing tends to be based on the average price of comparable listings.

This project aims to develop, select and optimize a data-driven short-term pricing model for existing platform clients.


Criteria for success: Develop and train a short-term pricing model which is better than the average price of similar listings.


Scope of solution Space: Analyze AirBnB listings, calendar, and review data for three cities. New York City (NYC), Jersey City (JC), and Rio. We include Jersey City for its proximity to NYC; comparing relevant variables between NYC and JC pricing models might provide insights into short-term pricing models. In addition, Rio data offers the opportunity for comparison and contrast between international markets.


Constrains: Our data is limited to AirBnB listings for the last 12 months.


Stakeholders: Short-term rental industry, owners, users, and hotels; real estate investors, community leaders, and local government.


Data Source: Data was collected from http://insideairbnb.com, an advocacy group about AirBnB’s impact on residential communities. Insideairbnb regularly scrapes AirbnB website for data.
